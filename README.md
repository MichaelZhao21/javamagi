# Java Magi

**WIP**: Project currently under development

This is a web app, created out of a need for a simple and extensible platform to have students submit Java code and get intelligent, simple, and automated feedback.

> The Magi were the three wise men who paid homage to the infant Jesus. This root is also used in the latin word for teacher, _magister_.
